This project is an end-to-end audio processing application that enables users to upload audio files and receive automatic transcriptions along with a brief analysis. The system consists of a FastAPI backend that handles audio file uploads, validates file types and sizes, and leverages the Groq API for transcription and content analysis. The backend returns the transcription, a word count, and summarized key points from the audio.

A Streamlit-based frontend provides a user-friendly interface for uploading audio files (WAV, MP3, M4A, OGG, FLAC), initiating processing, and viewing results, including the full transcription and analysis. The application is designed for ease of use, supporting both developers and non-technical users, and includes clear instructions and error handling throughout the process
